## Data Deletion

There are two ways to delete permanently **all** your data from our servers:

## Method 1 (instantaneous)

Open the Dumpus app, go to your settings and press the **"Quit and reset"** button. All your packages will be deleted from our servers.

## Method 2 (can take a few days)

Send us an email at `contact@dumpus.app` with your Package ID. You can get it by clicking the card **"Package ID"** under the **"Package details"** section in the settings. Do not include any other information (such as your Discord Data Package).
